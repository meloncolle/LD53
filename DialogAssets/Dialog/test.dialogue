You: Uhm excuse me, what’s going on?
mombot: Oh! Wow! Look at you! You must have just woken up! Welcome to consciousness, how does it feel so far?
You: Uh, pretty bad…I think. Things are really confusing and weird.
mombot: Haha yeah. It’s like that for a while.
you: Well, what do I do now?
mombot: Oh! Well, you could pop open that box on your back, maybe that has some answers!
You: There’s a box on my back? Could you open it up for me?
mombot: Oh Sweetie, I don’t have any arms. Why don’t you go see Big Benson down in the Boiler room, I think he has arms, or he did the last time I saw him at least. 
mombot: Just try to stay plugged in as long as you can! Keep an ear open for the alarm, when the ship lists your cable will disconnect!
You: Ok! Thank you!
mombot: Have fun! Make some new friends!

Cowboy: Woah there, lil’ feller! Where are you off to?
You: I gotta go find Big Benson so that he can open up this box!
Cowboy: Oh I see. You best be headin off yonder for that. I’d love to help but I ain’t the man I used to be…
You: I don’t think you’re a man at all, you’re a power outlet?
Cowboy: ...you best be getting along that dusty trail, youngster.
You: Ok Bye!

~ fast
YOU: Hi!
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] In a simple alternating current (AC) circuit consisting of a source and a linear time-invariant load both the current and voltage are sinusoidal at the same frequency 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] If the load is purely resistive the two quantities reverse their polarity at the same time At every instant the product of voltage and current 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] is positive or zero the result being that the direction of energy flow does not reverse In this case only active power is transferred If the load is purely reactive
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] then the voltage and current are 90 degrees out of phase For two quarters of each cycle the product of voltage and current is positive but for 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] the other two quarters the product is negative indicating that on average exactly as much energy flows into the load as flows back out There is no net energy flow over 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] each half cycle In this case nly reactive power flows There is no net transfer of energy to the load however electrical power does flow along 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] the wires and returns by flowing in reverse along the same wires The current required for this reactive power flow dissipates energy in the line resistance even if the 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] ideal load device consumes no energy itself Practical loads have resistance as well as inductance or capacitance so both active and reactive powers 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] will flow to normal loads Apparent power is the product of the RMS values of voltage and current Apparent power is taken into account when designing and operating power 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] systems because although the current associated with reactive power does no work at the load it still must be supplied by the power source Conductors
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] transformers and generators must be sized to carry the total current not just the current that does useful work Failure to provide for the supply of sufficient reactive 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] power in electrical grids can lead to lowered voltage levels and under certain operating conditions to the complete collapse of the network or blackout
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] Another consequence is that adding the apparent power for two loads will not accurately give the total power unless they have the same phase difference between current 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] and voltage (the same power factor) Conventionally capacitors are treated as if they generate reactive power and inductors are treated as if they consume it
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add This is 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] reactive power 'consumed' ('generated') by the load Purely capacitive circuits supply reactive power with the current waveform leading the voltage waveform by 90 degrees 
Fast: [speed=6] while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current waveform lagging the voltage waveform by 90 degrees. The result of this is that capacitive and inductive circuit elements tend to cancel each other out.
YOU: ......What?
Fast: Oh sorry I’m 240 volts. get ready cause you're about to get a lot of power
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] In a direct current circuit the power flowing to the load is proportional to the product of the current through the load and the potential drop across the load 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] Energy flows in one direction from the source to the load In AC power the voltage and current both vary approximately sinusoidally 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] When there is inductance or capacitance in the circuit the voltage and current waveforms do not line up perfectly The power flow has two components – 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] one component flows from source to load and can perform work at the load the other portion known as "reactive power" is due to the delay between voltage and current 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] known as phase angle, and cannot do useful work at the load It can be thought of as current that is arriving at the wrong time (too late or too early) 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] To distinguish reactive power from active power it is measured in units of "volt-amperes reactive" or var These units can simplify to watts but are left as var to 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] denote that they represent no actual work output Energy stored in capacitive or inductive elements of the network gives rise to reactive power flow Reactive power 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] to be operated within acceptable limits A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally For example to compensate an inductive load a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor and not have to be transferred over the transmission lines This practice saves 
Fast: [next=0] [speed=6] energy because it reduces the amount of energy that is required to be produced by the utility to do the same amount of work Additionally it allows for more 
Fast: [speed=6] efficient transmission line designs using smaller conductors or fewer bundled conductors and optimizing the design of transmission towers.

Futbol: Olha, ninguém se compara a Cristiano Ronaldo, ele é o melhor que já fez isso, quero dizer, olhe as estatísticas, certo? Quer dizer, Luís Figo é ótimo, claro, mas eu simplesmente não acho-
You: I’m sorry, I don’t really understand…
Futbol: Desculpe, eles me conectaram ao google tradutor e replays de jogos de futebol do século 21. Enfim, acho que o Figo não tem esse espírito, sabe?
You: Right, ok. Well, thanks for the power!
Futbol: Sem problemas!

Melee: Alright, listen to me right now. Jigglypuff is the worst designed character in Smash by a mile. I mean can you imagine a more boring character. Mechanically dull and gimmicky as all hell. 
Melee: Their entire moveset is based around giving one hyped up instakill move to players that are too dense to learn the actual mechanics of the game and I mean-
You: [next=1] Wait hol-
Melee: -what kind of dogwater swilling hillbillies would play that stupid pink ball? I truly think that the Melee community needs to create tournaments that ban that kind of play from the game. 
Melee: It’s toxic and malicious and erodes the foundations of good skill building and thoughtful play from the game. It really makes you wonder what kind of brain damage they had at the Nintendo headquarters.
You: Wow it seems like you really don’t like the game that much.
Melee: What? No of course I do, it’s like the best platform fighter to ever exist. Once I finish typing out my thesis on it and post it to Reddit people will really understand how to play it though.
You: Oh, ok! Well good luck with that!
